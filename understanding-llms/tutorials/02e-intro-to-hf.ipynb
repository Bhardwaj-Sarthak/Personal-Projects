        "## Introduction: ML models\n",
        "In the previous sheets, we have learned how to explicitly define neural networks and recurrent language models using native PyTorch. Further, we have seen the core steps of machine learning workflows with any kind of model, in general:\n",
        "1. prepare data (sheet 1.1, respective steps in sheets 2.2-2.4)\n",
        "2. define model architecture (i.e., define which layers with which parameters the network should have)\n",
        "3. train model on data\n",
        "4. evaluate model (sheet 2.4; more on evaluation of language models to come in future sessions)\n",
        "\n",
        "The contents of the single steps differ by application (e.g., we use different kinds of data and models to train an image classifier vs. to train a language model), but the general structure of the process is the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "With this background, in principle, you should be able to put together any well-known neural network yourself (e.g., implement Llama-3 or GPT-3, assuming sufficient time and access to information like PyTorch docs, details of the architecture, maybe some concepts from the next lecture, of course).\n",
        "\n",
        "However, putting together the network (i.e., specifying all the layers, their sizes, implementing the forward pass through the net etc.) does *not* mean that you will be able to use the model for generating predictions in practice. Generating predictions (= running inference) on new inputs (e.g., predicting continuations of new input texts or classifying new images) is the purpose of creating a machine learning model -- we build them because we want to automate these tasks. Ideally, we want the model to *generalize well* -- to be able to handle inputs for that the model was not trained on and still perform the task correctly (e.g., produce a sensible text completion for an entirely new text input).\n",
        "\n",
        "For generating predictions, we need the **trained** model, i.e., we need not just the definition of the model, but also the *model weights* set to optimized values that result from (successful) training. That is, we need the values of all the weight matrices (we have seen those in sheet 2.3). In practice, successful training of state-of-the-art models is quite costly and data-hungry (at least for creating actually useful models).\n",
        "\n",
        "**NB**: The practical sheets will try to be consistent and use the term \"architecture\" to refer to the more abstract definition, carcass, of a model (i.e,. the specific layer types and parameterizations underlying the model), and the term \"model\" for the particular instatiation with particular weights of that model configuration. When referring to a specific model instance, there are different important concepts / terms:\n",
        "* **pretrained** model: this is commonly used in the domains of NLP and computer vision (CV) where models are usually first trained on a very large collection of data to learn their task (in general). In the context of NLP, this refers to a model that has been trained to predict the next word on a large collection of text (e.g., on the Pile which we have seen in sheet 1.1). On a high level, this step can be thought of as the step where the model learns to predict fluent language in general. In the context of CV, this often refers to a model that has been trained to classify images on the ImageNet dataset.\n",
        "* **fine-tuned** model: this refers to a pretrained model that has been further trained on a *task-specific*, or, generally curated and therefore, usually smaller, dataset. This step can be thought of as optimizing the model for a particular task, like predicting texts in a particular domain (e.g., movie reviews). This is usually done based on a pretrained model because curated datasets are often too small to learn a task from scratch well.\n",
        "\n",
        "The term \"trained\" model will be mostly used as an umbrella terms for both types of models."

        "Luckily, there are many popular *open-source* models, i.e., those for which the architecture and the weights have been made freely accessible by the developers: e.g., GPT-2, the LLama models, BERT and others. In contrast, e.g., GPT-4 is *closed-source* -- we don't know exactly which layers with which configurations are inside the model, and we cannot access the weights ourselves; they are only hosted by OpenAI, and we can send our input data to their servers and get back predictions (by using the OpenAI API).\n",
        "\n",
        "Open-source models are frequently used by the community and have been made available via platforms and packages which provide an easy interface for loading pretrained models, generating predictions from these pretrained models, or training models from scratch. The by-far most used platform for open-source resources which we will heavily use in this course is [**HuggingFace**](https://huggingface.co/). HuggingFace provides infrastructure for working with many different types of machine learning models (for working with audio, vision, language tasks), but, as you might guess, we will be focusing on functionality relevant to language modeling. HuggingFace will often be abbreviated as HF throughout the sheets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is a high-level overview of all the nice things that HuggingFace provides:\n",
        "* (most relevant for us) the packages [`transformers`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index) and [`datasets`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index) which we already installed last week. These allow easy access and workflow with models and with datasets.\n",
        "  * Overviews, guides, tutorials for different tasks that can be done with `transformers`, docs for different models as well as the documentation of the API can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index).\n",
        "  * The same resources for `datasets` can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index).\n",
        "* The (online) HF platform called HuggingFace Hub actually stores trained model weights (also sometimes called checkpoints) and datasets. They are downloaded to the local machine when accessed through the `transformers` or `datasets` package. Available models can be browsed [here](https://huggingface.co/models); available datasets can be browsed [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets).\n",
        "  * In order to *upload* your own resources to HF Hub and in order to access some models (inclding LLama-2), you need a free account. It can easily be created on HF. So far, an account is not required for following the class.\n",
        "* The platform provides much more (feel free to explore, but also try not to feel overwhelmed if you are seeing HF for the first time). Here are some highlights most relevant to the course:\n",
        "  * [NLP course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/1) which includes practical tutorials for common NLP tasks with transformers.\n",
        "  * [`evaluate`](https://huggingface.co/docs/evaluate/index) package for computing common evaluation metrics (more on this in the next sessions).\n",
        "  * Further (more advanced) packages for [accelerated](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index) and parallelized training on GPUs, via parameter-efficient fine-tuning ([PEFT](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/index)) and more.\n",
        "  * The `tokenizers` [package](https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/index), which we will not make (heavy) use of, because we will only use functionality of pretrained tokenizers which are shipped together with models via transformers.\n"

        "To provide a somewhat more detailed outlook, the `transformers` package actually uses many different building blocks which are often based on abstract classes; these abstract building blocks act as 'blueprints' for configuring different models and using them for different tasks.\n",
        "For example, the `AutoTokenizer` class is a high-level wrapper around model-specific tokenizers, which has functionality to load a pre-rtained model-specific tokenizer and automatically infer the relevant set up. This is done by wrapping model-specific around a higher-level `PreTrainedTokenizerBase` class.\n",
        "The same happens when loading models: `transformers` provides a large set of model-specific classes like `GPT2LMHeadModel`, but also has a class which automatically infers which model is being instantiated: `AutoModelForCausalLM`. The model instantiation works through a `Config` object which is loaded in the background, which essentialy provides the blueprint of the transformer architecture for the specific model.\n",
        "When loading a pretrained model from HF Hub (via `pipeline` or via `.from_prtetrained()`), in the background, `transformers` loads a `config.json` file from the model repository and uses it to instantiate the model. Once the model is loaded, you can actually access the configs like this:"

              "{'text': 'I rented I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW from my video store because of all the controversy that surrounded it when it was first released in 1967. I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered \"controversial\" I really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it\\'s not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn\\'t have much of a plot.',\n",

        "**IMPORTANT:** it is key to understand the language modeling objective (i.e., mechanism used to train a model to predict the next token) and how it is implemented in practice. Conceptually, the LM objective is discussed at the beginning of the tutorial. In terms of implementation, the addition of special tokens and shifting happens within each transformers model, it is taken care of by the package. You can find and example for GPT-2 [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/571dd693b5d20754ecc472030903a94f92cfa9f8/src/transformers/models/gpt2/modeling_gpt2.py#L1100). As you can see, the collator function above creates the labels that are used as target for prediction for us. Please make sure that you understand this step and that you would be able to create labels, given an input, yourself. Note that if you manually implement the language modeling loss function (e.g., using the CrossEntropyLoss), you will have to do the processing of the inputs and labels yourself."
